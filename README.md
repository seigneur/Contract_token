# Token Sale Contract and IEO contracts

We create a generic MintableToken with additional parameters for exchange address, to enable IEO of the token.

# Roadmap
1. We deploy the TraceToToken and mint the tokens.
2. For Deployment we have to supply a date period till when the tokens are locked.
3. The lock in 2 is not applicable to the exchange IEO contract which also has to be supplied.


Big thanks to [openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) for their code base.
